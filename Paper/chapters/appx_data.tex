\section{Exporting RPNA data from WRDS}

The RavenPack News Analytics dataset is split by year and by product in the WRDS database. Hence, the source table in the code below (DJ\_EQUITIES\_2000) needs to be changed for each year, and EQUITIES needs to be replaced by GLOBAL\_MACRO for non-equity stories. This amounts to a total of 40 tables to then export in CSV format.

\section{Tables Schema}

Decide whether to include all columns or only the ones that were actually used. Also, is it better to provide a table or the code used to create the tables? And, to what extent should I describe the process from of import from CSV to SQL Server tables? To what extent should I describe the columns that I don't use (I already reference the official CRSP documentation)?\todo{I would not describe what I did not use as it produces tables that don't fit on a page.} RPNA documentation is only available to clients. \todo{Clarify this before doing more work.}
