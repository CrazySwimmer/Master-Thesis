Timestamp are reported UTC, a first transformation was to convert the timestamps to America/New\_York in order for the dates to be consistent with the local time at which the Wall Street Journal publishes its daily issue.

An issue with RPNA is that the timestamp of the articles are not from the news source but from the time the news was recorded by RavenPack. As a consequence, the stories from the Wall Street Journal are spread over twenty-four hours even though it is a daily print newspaper. We therefore need to define a cutoff time to include articles on one day or the next. For example, an article with a timestamp around noon would be considered having been reported the same day, and an article with a timestamp around 3am is considered as being reported on the previous day.

Also, we assume that over 20 years, the way RavenPack receives and processes news articles might have changed and therefore our cutoff method may be correct only for part of the period.

\todo{Decide how to cut off timestamp. Effective time vs processing time.}
