They hypothesize that comovement increases when exogenous events (high lotteries jackpots) attract investors' limited attention away from financial markets, hence increasing comovement as investors tend to focus more on aggregate signals rather than idiosyncratics signals.
Their scope is slightly different from mine in that they focus on retail investors and are able to make a causal conclusion because of lottery jackpots being exogenous events.
There exist a similar paper that reproduces study on Shenzen markets. Similar findings.},

  comment   = {This seminal paper from Grossman and Stiglitz introduce the idea that, under cost-free information, a competitive economy cannot always be in equilibrium.
For the information to be cost-free, we need prices to reflect all information (ie. investors cannot make extra profit by gathering additional information about a company). In this case, investors are not incentivized to spend resources and accept a price as given.
However, if no investor is willing to gather additional information, how can the asset price fully reflect all available information? This is the Grossman-Stiglitz Paradox (not explicitely mentioned in the paper). Under cost-free information, only minimal to no trading happens as each investor has the same set of beliefs.
Under costly information, some investors will find attractive the option to dig information and make extra-profits while other investors will stay "uninformed". Under this assumption, beliefs won't always be the same and trading will happen (ie. an equilibrium can be found).},

An information market complementarity can explain these anomalies. Because information has high fixed costs, high volume makes it inexpensive. Low prices induce investors to buy information that others buy. Given two identical assets, investors learn about one; abundant information reduces its payoff risk and raises its price. Transitions between low-information/low-asset-price and high-information/high-asset-price equilibria resemble frenzies. Equity data and new panel data on news coverage support the model's predictions: Asset market movements generate news and news raises prices and price dispersion.},

  abstract  = {Traditional asset pricing models predict that covariance between prices of different assets sholud be lower than what we observe in the data. This paper introduces markets for information that generate high price covariance within a rational expectations framework. When information is costly, rational investors only buy information about a subset of the assets. Because information production has high fixed costs, competitive producers charge more for low-demand information than for high-demand information. The low price of high-demand information makes investors want to purchase the same information that others are purchasing. When investors price assets using a common subset of information, news about one asset affects the other assets' prices; asset prices comove. The cross-sectional and time-series properties of comovement are consistent with this explanation.},

The reason is that, in good times, less desirable assets with low average cash flows and high loading on market risk perform similar to more desirable assets with high average cash flows and low market risk, rendering them difficult to distinguish. However, their relative fundamental performance diverges in downturns, enabling better inference. Consistent with these predictions, stocks' reaction to earnings news is up to 70% stronger in downturns than in upturns..},

The cross-sectional approach resolves endogeneity problems associated with event study demonstrations of excess comovement. A trading strategy that bets on the reversion of stock prices of overweighted stocks generates economic profits, confirming that the observed comovement patterns are excessive, and providing further evidence that comovement of stock returns can be a consequence of commonality in trading behavior.},
